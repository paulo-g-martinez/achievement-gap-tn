### Department of Education Achievement Profile data

<p>The education data (achievement_profile_data_with_CORE.csv) is from the 2014-15 school year. It is not available for download, but can be largely understood from what’s available on this page: https://www.tn.gov/education/data/data-downloads.html. In particular you’ll want to look at Profile Data Files, Base Accountability File, ACT Data, Attendance and Graduation, and Discipline Data. There’s a Data Definitions file at the bottom of the page which describes the data. </p>
